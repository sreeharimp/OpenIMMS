# OpenIMMS

**Open Injection Moulding Manufacturing System**
*A risk-based, science-driven, open framework for injection moulding process development, validation, and control*

---

## What is OpenIMMS?

OpenIMMS is an open-source, vendor-neutral manufacturing system designed to help organizations develop, validate, and control injection moulding processes in a consistent, scalable, and audit-ready manner.

It is inspired by globally accepted best practices (such as scientific injection moulding and OEM manufacturing systems) and grounded in internationally recognized standards.

OpenIMMS is suitable for:

* Medical, automotive, and industrial injection moulding
* In-house manufacturing and contract manufacturing
* Regulated and non-regulated environments

---

## Why OpenIMMS?

Injection moulding guidance is often:

* Proprietary (OEM manuals)
* Fragmented (standards in isolation)
* Difficult to scale across sites and suppliers

OpenIMMS addresses this gap by providing:

* A **risk-based validation philosophy**
* A **scientific, data-driven approach** to moulding
* A **scalable manufacturing system** usable across factories
* **Open templates** that can be adapted without loss of control

---

## Core Principles

1. **Risk Drives Rigor**
   Validation depth and control levels are defined based on risk, aligned with ISO 14971.

2. **Science Over Tribal Knowledge**
   Decisions are based on scientific injection moulding principles rather than experience alone.

3. **Process Windows, Not Recipes**
   Robust operating windows are preferred over fixed, single-point settings.

4. **Validation as a System, Not an Event**
   Validation is integrated with change management and continual improvement.

5. **Scalable by Design**
   The system can be deployed across machines, sites, and external suppliers.

## Reference Standards and Practices

OpenIMMS is informed by the following publicly available standards and best practices:

* ISO 14971 – Risk management for medical devices
* ISO 13485 – Quality management systems
* FDA Process Validation Guidance (IQ–OQ–PQ)
* Scientific Injection Moulding (SIM)
* ISO 20457 – Plastics moulded parts
* AIAG Molding System Assessment (MSA)
* VDA 6.3 – Process audit
* IATF 16949 – Process validation and change control clauses

References to proprietary OEM systems are conceptual and non-derivative.
