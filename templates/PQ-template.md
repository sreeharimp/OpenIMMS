# OpenIMMS – Performance Qualification (PQ)

**Protocol & Report Template**

---

## 1. Purpose

This Performance Qualification (PQ) protocol defines the activities required to demonstrate that a validated injection moulding process, developed and qualified using OpenIMMS, performs effectively and reproducibly under **normal production conditions**.

PQ confirms that the process operates within the **validated process window** and consistently produces conforming product when routine manufacturing variables are present.

This template is aligned with **ISO 13485**, **IATF 16949**, **FDA Process Validation**, and **OpenIMMS** requirements.

---

## 2. Scope

This PQ applies to:

* Injection moulding processes that have completed IQ and OQ
* Routine production conditions (operators, shifts, material lots)
* Normal production rates and controls

---

## 3. Reference Documents

* OpenIMMS Validation Model (IQ–OQ–PQ)
* OpenIMMS Scientific Injection Moulding (SIM) Framework
* OpenIMMS Risk–Parameter Traceability Matrix
* OpenIMMS Validation Master Plan (VMP)
* Approved OQ Report
* Control Plan

## 4. Responsibilities

| Role            | Responsibility                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Validation Lead | PQ planning and execution          |
| Production      | Execution under routine conditions |
| Quality         | Review and approval                |
| Engineering     | Technical support                  |

---

## 5. Preconditions for PQ

PQ shall not be initiated unless:

* IQ and OQ are approved
* CPPs and validated process window are defined
* Control plan is approved and implemented
* Operators are trained

---

## 6. PQ Strategy

PQ shall be designed to challenge the process under **normal manufacturing variability**, which may include:

* Multiple operators
* Multiple shifts
* Normal material lots
* Routine production rate

The extent of PQ shall be **risk-based**, with higher-risk products requiring broader coverage.

## 7. PQ Execution Plan

### 7.1 Production Conditions

| Parameter        | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Machine          |             |
| Mould            |             |
| Material / Lot   |             |
| Operators        |             |
| Shifts           |             |
| Planned Quantity |             |

---

### 7.2 Monitoring of Critical Process Parameters (CPPs)

CPPs identified during OQ shall be:

* Monitored during PQ
* Maintained within validated limits
* Evaluated for stability

Attach CPP monitoring records as applicable.

---

### 7.3 Product Evaluation

Product evaluation during PQ may include:

* Dimensional inspection
* Functional testing
* Visual inspection
* Performance testing (as applicable)

Sampling plan and inspection methods shall be defined prior to execution.

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

PQ acceptance shall be based on:

* Conformance to product specifications
* No unapproved deviations
* CPPs maintained within validated limits
* Acceptable defect and scrap levels
* Confirmation of residual risk acceptability

Acceptance criteria shall be objective, measurable, and documented prior to execution.

---

## 9. Deviations

| Deviation No. | Description | Impact Assessment | Disposition |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- |

All deviations shall be assessed for impact on product quality and risk prior to PQ approval.

---

## 10. Data Analysis and Summary

Summarize:

* PQ execution details
* Results and trends
* Observed variability
* Confirmation of process stability

---

## 11. Conclusion

Based on the results of PQ execution, the process is:

☐ Acceptable for routine production
☐ Not acceptable – further action required

Provide justification.
