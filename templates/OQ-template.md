# OpenIMMS – Operational Qualification (OQ)

**Protocol & Report Template**

---

## 1. Purpose

This Operational Qualification (OQ) protocol defines the activities required to establish and document a **robust, scientifically justified operating window** for an injection moulding process in accordance with **OpenIMMS**, **ISO 14971**, **ISO 13485**, **IATF 16949**, and **FDA Process Validation** principles.

OQ demonstrates that critical process parameters (CPPs) can be controlled within defined limits to consistently produce conforming product.

---

## 2. Scope

This OQ applies to:

* Injection moulding process parameters
* Mould, machine, and material interactions
* Critical and key process parameters identified through risk analysis

---

## 3. Reference Documents

* OpenIMMS Validation Model (IQ–OQ–PQ)
* OpenIMMS Scientific Injection Moulding (SIM) Framework
* OpenIMMS Risk–Parameter Traceability Matrix
* OpenIMMS Validation Master Plan (VMP)
* Applicable PFMEA (automotive)
* Equipment and material specifications
