# OpenIMMS Governance

This document defines how OpenIMMS is maintained, evolved, and protected as an open, neutral manufacturing system.

---

## 1. Purpose of Governance

The governance model ensures that OpenIMMS:

* Remains technically credible and neutral
* Aligns with internationally accepted standards
* Evolves in a controlled and transparent manner
* Avoids fragmentation, misuse, or proprietary capture

Governance is intentionally lightweight, focusing on quality and clarity rather than bureaucracy.

---

## 2. Scope of Governance

This governance applies to:

* The OpenIMMS System Manual
* All OpenIMMS templates, frameworks, and guidance documents
* Structural changes to OpenIMMS architecture

This governance does **not** control how individual organizations implement OpenIMMS internally.

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### 3.1 Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:

* Reviewing and approving changes
* Ensuring alignment with OpenIMMS principles
* Maintaining consistency and clarity
* Managing official releases and versioning

Maintainers act as stewards, not owners, of OpenIMMS.

---

### 3.2 Contributors

Contributors may:

* Propose changes
* Submit improvements
* Report issues or ambiguities
* Suggest new templates or examples

Contributors are expected to:

* Follow OpenIMMS principles
* Respect the open-source license
* Avoid inclusion of proprietary or confidential content

---

### 3.3 Users

Users may:

* Use OpenIMMS freely under the license
* Adapt OpenIMMS to their organization
* Reference OpenIMMS in SOPs, audits, or supplier agreements

Users retain full responsibility for regulatory compliance and implementation.

## 4. Decision-Making Principles

All decisions regarding OpenIMMS evolution shall be guided by the following principles:

1. **Patient and Product Safety First**
   Changes must not reduce risk control or validation rigor.

2. **Standards Alignment**
   Alignment with ISO, FDA, and industry best practices takes precedence over individual preference.

3. **Clarity Over Complexity**
   Simpler, clearer guidance is preferred over overly complex prescriptions.

4. **Backward Compatibility Where Practical**
   Changes should not unnecessarily invalidate existing implementations.

---

## 5. Change Management Process

### 5.1 Proposing Changes

Changes may be proposed via:

* Issues
* Pull requests
* Formal change proposals

Each proposal should clearly state:

* What is being changed
* Why the change is needed
* Impact on existing documents

---

### 5.2 Review and Approval

* All changes are reviewed by maintainers
* Technical and regulatory implications are evaluated
* Approved changes are merged into the main branch

Major changes may require extended review or public discussion.

---

## 6. Versioning and Releases

OpenIMMS follows semantic-style versioning for clarity:

* **Major (X.0)** – Structural or philosophical changes
* **Minor (X.Y)** – New sections, templates, or clarifications
* **Patch (X.Y.Z)** – Corrections, clarifications, formatting

Each release includes:

* Version number
* Release date
* Summary of changes

---

## 7. Use of References

OpenIMMS may reference international standards and industry best practices.

Restrictions:

* No proprietary or copyrighted material may be reproduced
* References are conceptual and non-derivative
* No endorsement or certification claims are implied

---

## 8. Attribution and Licensing

All OpenIMMS content is licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)**.

Contributions are accepted with the understanding that they will be licensed under the same terms.

---

## 9. Conflict Resolution

In case of disagreement:

* Technical correctness and safety take precedence
* Relevant international standards are used as arbitration reference
* Maintainers make the final decision

---

## 10. Disclaimer

OpenIMMS is provided as guidance only. Governance of OpenIMMS does not imply responsibility for individual implementations, regulatory compliance, or product performance.

---

## 11. Evolution of Governance

This governance model itself may evolve as OpenIMMS matures. Changes to governance follow the same review and versioning process as other OpenIMMS documents.
