# OpenIMMS – Validation Master Plan (VMP)

**Template for Adoption of OpenIMMS Validation Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This Validation Master Plan (VMP) defines the overall strategy, scope, responsibilities, and approach for validating injection moulding processes in accordance with **OpenIMMS**, using a **risk-based methodology** aligned with **ISO 14971**, **ISO 13485**, and **FDA Process Validation (IQ–OQ–PQ)**.

This document serves as the top-level control for all validation activities covered under its scope.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

* Injection moulding processes covered under OpenIMMS
* New moulds, machines, materials, or sites
* Process changes requiring revalidation

### 2.2 Out of Scope

* Product design validation
* Regulatory submissions
* Non-moulding processes (unless explicitly stated)

---

## 3. Reference Documents

* OpenIMMS System Manual
* OpenIMMS Validation Model (IQ–OQ–PQ)
* OpenIMMS Scientific Injection Moulding (SIM) Framework
* OpenIMMS Risk–Parameter Traceability Matrix
* ISO 14971 – Risk management
* ISO 13485 – Quality management systems
* FDA Process Validation Guidance
* IATF 16949 – Process validation and change control

*This Validation Master Plan is designed to meet the process validation requirements of both automotive (IATF 16949 / AIAG) and medical device (ISO 13485 / FDA) standards using a common risk-based framework.*

---

## 4. Validation Philosophy

Validation activities under this VMP are based on the following principles:

* Validation depth is **risk-driven**
* Scientific understanding precedes validation
* Operating windows are validated, not single settings
* Validation is a lifecycle activity

---

## 5. Validation Approach

OpenIMMS adopts the FDA three-stage lifecycle:

1. **Installation Qualification (IQ)**
   Verification that equipment and infrastructure are suitable for use.

2. **Operational Qualification (OQ)**
   Establishment of a robust, scientifically justified process window.

3. **Performance Qualification (PQ)**
   Confirmation of stable performance under normal production conditions.

---

## 6. Risk-Based Validation Strategy

### 6.1 Risk Classification

Processes and characteristics shall be classified based on risk (High / Medium / Low) using ISO 14971 principles.

### 6.2 Impact on Validation Depth

| Risk Level | Validation Expectation                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| High       | Full IQ–OQ–PQ with extensive SIM studies |
| Medium     | IQ–OQ–PQ with focused studies            |
| Low        | Justified reduced validation             |

For automotive applications, risks and critical process parameters shall be aligned with the **Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA)** and reflected in the **Control Plan**.

---

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role            | Responsibility                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Process Owner   | Overall validation accountability    |
| Validation Lead | Planning and execution of validation |
| Quality         | Review and approval                  |
| Production      | Execution support                    |

---

## 8. Validation Deliverables

The following documents shall be generated as applicable:

* IQ Protocol and Report
* OQ Protocol and Report
* PQ Protocol and Report
* Risk–Parameter Traceability Matrix
* Control Plan
* Validation Summary Report

**Acceptance criteria for IQ, OQ, and PQ shall be defined prior to execution and shall be objective, measurable, and risk-based.**

---

## 9. Change Control and Revalidation

Any change affecting validated elements shall be assessed through formal change control.

Revalidation requirements (partial or full) shall be determined based on risk impact.

### Typical Revalidation Triggers

| Change Type           | Revalidation Requirement |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Machine change        | IQ + OQ                  |
| Mould modification    | OQ                       |
| Material grade change | OQ + PQ                  |
| CPP change            | Risk-based decision      |

---

## 10. Deviation Handling

Any deviation from approved validation protocols shall be:

* Documented
* Assessed for risk impact
* Approved prior to continuation

All validation documents shall be controlled in accordance with the organization’s document control procedures.

---

## 11. Approval

This Validation Master Plan shall be approved prior to execution of validation activities.
