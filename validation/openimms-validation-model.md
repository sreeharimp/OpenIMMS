# OpenIMMS Validation Model

**Risk‑Based Injection Moulding Process Validation (IQ–OQ–PQ)**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the OpenIMMS validation model for injection moulding processes. It establishes a structured, risk‑based approach to process validation aligned with ISO 14971, ISO 13485, and FDA Process Validation principles (IQ–OQ–PQ), while embedding scientific injection moulding practices.

The objective is to ensure that injection moulding processes are:

* Capable of consistently producing conforming product
* Scientifically understood and controlled
* Scalable across machines, sites, and suppliers

---

## 2. Scope

This validation model applies to:

* New injection moulding processes
* New moulds or tools
* New materials or grades
* Transfer of moulds between machines, sites, or suppliers
* Significant process or equipment changes

---

## 3. Reference Framework

The OpenIMMS validation model is informed by:

* ISO 14971 – Risk management
* ISO 13485 – Validation and documentation control
* FDA Process Validation Guidance (IQ–OQ–PQ)
* Scientific Injection Moulding (SIM)
* ISO 20457 – Plastics moulded parts
* AIAG Molding System Assessment (MSA)
* VDA 6.3 and IATF 16949 (process control and change management)

---

## 4. Risk‑Based Validation Philosophy

### 4.1 Risk Drives Validation Depth

The extent of validation activities is determined by risk analysis performed in accordance with ISO 14971.

Key principles:

* High‑risk characteristics require deeper validation
* Critical process parameters are derived from risk analysis
* Validation effort is proportional to potential patient, user, or product risk

### 4.2 Risk Management Inputs

Prior to validation, the following shall be available:

* Risk Management File or equivalent
* Identification of product and process hazards
* Preliminary classification of critical characteristics

---

## 5. Validation Lifecycle Overview

OpenIMMS adopts the FDA three‑stage process validation lifecycle:

1. **Installation Qualification (IQ)** – Verification of readiness
2. **Operational Qualification (OQ)** – Definition of a robust process window
3. **Performance Qualification (PQ)** – Confirmation of stable production performance

Validation is considered complete only when all three stages are approved.

---

## 6. Installation Qualification (IQ)

### 6.1 Objective

To verify and document that the injection moulding process infrastructure is correctly installed and suitable for intended use.

### 6.2 IQ Elements

IQ shall confirm:

* Injection moulding machine suitability (clamp force, shot capacity)
* Mould installation and safety features
* Utility availability and stability (power, cooling, air)
* Auxiliary equipment readiness (dryers, temperature controllers, robots)
* Calibration and maintenance status

### 6.3 IQ Outputs

* Completed IQ checklist
* Equipment identification and configuration records
* Calibration evidence
* IQ approval

---

## 7. Operational Qualification (OQ)

### 7.1 Objective

To establish and document a scientifically justified operating window that consistently produces acceptable parts.

### 7.2 Scientific Injection Moulding Integration

OQ shall be based on scientific injection moulding principles, including:

* Short‑shot studies
* Transfer (V→P) stability studies
* Viscosity or melt stability assessment
* Packing and gate‑seal studies
* Cooling optimization
* Pressure and sensitivity studies

### 7.3 Critical Process Parameters (CPPs)

CPPs shall be:

* Identified through risk analysis
* Linked to specific hazards or failure modes
* Evaluated across upper and lower operating limits

### 7.4 OQ Outputs

* Defined nominal settings and operating ranges
* Identification of fixed vs adjustable parameters
* Evidence of process robustness
* Approved OQ report

---

## 8. Performance Qualification (PQ)

### 8.1 Objective

To demonstrate that the validated process performs effectively under normal production conditions.

### 8.2 PQ Execution

PQ shall typically include:

* Production‑rate runs
* Multiple operators and shifts (as applicable)
* Normal material lots
* Routine production controls

### 8.3 Acceptance Criteria

PQ acceptance shall be based on:

* Conformance to specifications
* Process stability (e.g., SPC where applicable)
* Confirmation of acceptable scrap and defect levels
* Residual risk acceptability

### 8.4 PQ Outputs

* PQ protocol and report
* Production capability evidence
* Final validation approval

---

## 9. Change Control and Revalidation

Any change affecting validated elements shall be evaluated through a formal change control process.

Examples of revalidation triggers:

* Machine change
* Mould modification
* Material grade change
* CPPs outside validated limits

Risk analysis shall determine the extent of revalidation required (partial or full IQ/OQ/PQ).

---

## 10. Documentation and Traceability

The following traceability shall be maintained:

* Risk → Process parameter → Validation evidence
* Validation outputs → Control plan
* Change request → Revalidation decision

---

## 11. Completion and Release

A process shall be considered validated only when:

* IQ, OQ, and PQ are completed and approved
* Risks are reduced to acceptable levels
* Control mechanisms are implemented

---

## 12. Disclaimer

This validation model provides guidance under OpenIMMS. Organizations are responsible for ensuring regulatory compliance and suitability for their specific applications.
