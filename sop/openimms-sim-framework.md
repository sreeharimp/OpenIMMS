# OpenIMMS – Scientific Injection Moulding (SIM) Framework

**A structured, science-based approach to defining robust injection moulding processes**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the OpenIMMS Scientific Injection Moulding (SIM) Framework. It provides a standardized, data-driven methodology to understand material behavior, establish robust process windows, and support risk-based process validation in accordance with the OpenIMMS Validation Model.

The SIM Framework ensures that injection moulding processes are developed using repeatable science rather than fixed recipes or operator intuition.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to:

* Development and optimization of injection moulding processes
* Operational Qualification (OQ) activities
* Establishment of critical process parameters (CPPs)
* Process transfers between machines, sites, or suppliers

---

## 3. Principles of Scientific Injection Moulding

OpenIMMS SIM is founded on the following principles:

1. **Separate Fill and Pack Phases**
   Control the filling phase independently from the packing/holding phase.

2. **Understand Material Behavior**
   Process development begins with understanding melt flow and stability.

3. **Define Operating Windows**
   Processes are validated over ranges, not single-point settings.

4. **Decouple Process from Machine**
   Use cavity-focused and physics-based parameters wherever practical.

5. **Link Process Parameters to Risk**
   CPPs are justified through risk analysis (ISO 14971).

## 4. SIM Within the OpenIMMS Validation Lifecycle

| Validation Stage | Role of SIM                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IQ               | Confirm machine capability to execute SIM-defined process       |
| OQ               | Core SIM studies to define the process window                   |
| PQ               | Confirm SIM-defined window performs under production conditions |

SIM activities are primarily executed during **Operational Qualification (OQ)**.

## 5. SIM Study Set (Core Requirements)

The following studies form the **minimum SIM study set** under OpenIMMS. The extent and rigor of each study shall be determined by risk.

---

### 5.1 Short Shot / Fill Study

**Objective:**

* Understand cavity fill balance and flow progression

**Method:**

* Incrementally increase shot size
* Observe fill pattern and consistency

**Outputs:**

* Balanced fill confirmation
* Identification of fill-related risks

---

### 5.2 Melt Stability / Viscosity Assessment

**Objective:**

* Evaluate material consistency across processing conditions

**Method:**

* Monitor fill or injection pressure at constant fill conditions
* Observe variation across cycles

**Outputs:**

* Material stability assessment
* Input to transfer point selection

---

### 5.3 Transfer (Velocity-to-Pressure) Study

**Objective:**

* Establish a stable and repeatable transfer point

**Method:**

* Adjust transfer position or pressure
* Evaluate part weight, appearance, and stability

**Outputs:**

* Defined transfer point
* Reduced sensitivity to material variation

---

### 5.4 Packing / Gate Seal Study

**Objective:**

* Determine minimum hold time and pressure required to seal the gate

**Method:**

* Incrementally increase hold time
* Measure part weight or dimensions

**Outputs:**

* Gate seal time
* Pack/hold window definition

---

### 5.5 Cooling Optimization Study

**Objective:**

* Establish cooling time required for dimensional and functional stability

**Method:**

* Incrementally adjust cooling time
* Evaluate part distortion and ejection behavior

**Outputs:**

* Minimum effective cooling time
* Cycle time optimization

---

### 5.6 Pressure / Sensitivity Study

**Objective:**

* Assess part sensitivity to pressure-related parameters

**Method:**

* Vary key pressures within controlled limits
* Observe defect formation and dimensional change

**Outputs:**

* Identification of sensitive parameters
* Risk-informed parameter limits

---

## 6. Classification of Process Parameters

Based on SIM studies and risk analysis, parameters shall be classified as:

* **Fixed Parameters** – Must not be adjusted without revalidation
* **Controlled Parameters** – Adjustable within validated limits
* **Monitored Parameters** – Observed for trends

This classification shall be documented and justified.

---

## 7. SIM Outputs and Deliverables

SIM execution shall result in:

* Defined process window
* Identification of CPPs
* Evidence supporting OQ conclusions
* Inputs to control plans and SOPs

SIM outputs form a key part of the **Operational Qualification (OQ) report**.

---

## 8. SIM and Risk Management Integration

Each SIM study shall be traceable to:

* Identified hazards
* Failure modes
* Risk control measures

This linkage ensures that SIM activities directly support risk reduction as required by ISO 14971.

---

## 9. Use in Multi-Site and Supplier Environments

SIM-defined process windows shall be used as the baseline for:

* Machine-to-machine transfer
* Site-to-site transfer
* Supplier process qualification

Equivalence shall be demonstrated when exact replication is not feasible.

---

## 10. Documentation and Records

Minimum documentation includes:

* SIM study protocols
* Raw data and observations
* Summary conclusions
* Approval records

---

## 11. Disclaimer

This SIM framework is provided as guidance under OpenIMMS. Organizations are responsible for determining suitability, execution detail, and regulatory compliance for their specific applications.
