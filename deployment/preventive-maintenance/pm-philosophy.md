# OpenIMMS – Preventive Maintenance (PM) Philosophy

**Maintaining the Validated State of Injection Moulding Processes**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the OpenIMMS philosophy for preventive maintenance (PM) of injection moulding machines and moulds. It establishes PM as a **critical risk control measure** to ensure that validated injection moulding processes remain capable, stable, and compliant throughout their lifecycle.

The objective is to ensure that process validation achieved through IQ–OQ–PQ is **sustained**, not degraded, during routine production.

---

## 2. Scope

This philosophy applies to:

* Injection moulding machines
* Moulds and tooling
* Auxiliary equipment influencing the moulding process
* All OpenIMMS-adopted sites and processes

---

## 3. Core Principle

> **A validated process remains valid only while the machine and mould remain in a validated condition.**

Preventive maintenance is therefore an integral part of process control, not a standalone maintenance activity.

---

## 4. PM as a Risk Control Measure (ISO 14971)

Under OpenIMMS, preventive maintenance is treated as a **risk control** in accordance with ISO 14971.

Failure to maintain machines or moulds can result in:

* Loss of dimensional control
* Increased defect rates
* Material degradation
* Contamination risks (medical applications)
* Undetected drift in critical process parameters

PM activities are therefore linked directly to:

* Identified hazards
* Critical Process Parameters (CPPs)
* Residual risk acceptability

---

## 5. Relationship Between PM and Validation

Preventive maintenance supports validation by:

* Preserving machine capability verified during IQ
* Maintaining mould condition used to establish the OQ process window
* Ensuring PQ results remain representative of ongoing production

OpenIMMS distinguishes between:

* **Routine PM** – does not impact validation when executed as approved
* **Critical PM** – may require validation impact assessment

---

## 6. PM and Change Management

Any PM activity that may affect:

* Part geometry
* Process capability
* Thermal or pressure behavior

shall be evaluated through formal change control to determine validation impact.

PM activities shall **not** be used to introduce unapproved process or tooling changes.

---

## 7. Risk-Based PM Strategy

PM requirements shall be defined based on:

* Product risk classification (medical / automotive / industrial)
* Material type and sensitivity
* Process sensitivity identified during SIM studies
* Historical performance and wear patterns

Higher-risk applications require tighter PM discipline and documentation.

---

## 8. Evidence and Records

PM activities under OpenIMMS shall be supported by:

* Documented PM plans
* Execution records
* Identification of critical components
* Linkage to validation and risk documentation

Records shall be retained in accordance with organizational and regulatory requirements.

---

## 9. Governance

PM expectations defined under OpenIMMS:

* Are mandatory for OpenIMMS adoption
* May be supplemented by site-specific procedures
* Shall not be weakened without documented justification

---

## 10. Disclaimer

This preventive maintenance philosophy provides guidance under OpenIMMS. Organizations remain responsible for defining detailed PM procedures, execution frequency, and regulatory compliance based on their specific applications and operating conditions.
