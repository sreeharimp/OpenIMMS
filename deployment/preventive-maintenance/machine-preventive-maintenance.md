# OpenIMMS – Machine Preventive Maintenance Expectations

**Maintaining Injection Moulding Machine Capability to Preserve the Validated State**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the minimum preventive maintenance (PM) expectations for injection moulding machines under OpenIMMS. It establishes standardized maintenance requirements to ensure machines remain capable of executing validated processes without drift, degradation, or uncontrolled variation.

Machine PM is treated as a **risk control measure** supporting process validation and ongoing process capability.

---

## 2. Scope

These expectations apply to:

* Injection moulding machines (hydraulic, hybrid, electric)
* Injection units, clamping systems, and controls
* Machine subsystems that directly influence Critical Process Parameters (CPPs)

---

## 3. PM Classification

Machine PM activities are classified as:

* **Routine PM** – Planned activities with no expected validation impact
* **Critical PM** – Activities that may affect process behavior and require validation impact assessment

---

## 4. Mandatory Machine PM Systems

The following machine systems are considered **critical** under OpenIMMS and shall be included in PM programs.

---

### 4.1 Injection Unit

**Components:**

* Screw
* Barrel
* Non-return valve (NRV)
* Heaters and thermocouples

**PM Expectations:**

* Inspection for wear, damage, or material build-up
* Verification of heater band integrity and temperature accuracy
* NRV condition monitoring

**Validation Impact:**

* Replacement of screw, barrel, or NRV requires validation impact assessment

---

### 4.2 Clamping System

**Components:**

* Tie bars
* Platens
* Toggle or hydraulic clamping mechanism

**PM Expectations:**

* Lubrication and alignment checks
* Inspection for wear, cracks, or deformation
* Clamp force verification (as applicable)

**Validation Impact:**

* Changes affecting clamp force or parallelism require risk assessment

---

### 4.3 Hydraulic / Servo System

**Components:**

* Pumps and motors
* Valves
* Hydraulic oil (where applicable)

**PM Expectations:**

* Leak inspection
* Pressure stability verification
* Oil condition monitoring (hydraulic machines)

**Validation Impact:**

* Changes impacting pressure stability require evaluation

---

### 4.4 Temperature Control System

**Components:**

* Barrel temperature control
* Mold temperature interfaces
* Cooling system interfaces

**PM Expectations:**

* Verification of temperature control accuracy
* Inspection of sensors and wiring
* Confirmation of alarm functionality

**Validation Impact:**

* Temperature control changes affecting CPPs require assessment

---

### 4.5 Controls, Sensors, and Software

**Components:**

* Pressure sensors
* Position encoders
* Machine control software

**PM Expectations:**

* Verification of sensor functionality
* Backup and control of software versions
* Alarm and interlock testing

**Validation Impact:**

* Software updates or sensor replacements require validation impact assessment

---

### 4.6 Safety Systems

**Components:**

* Safety gates
* Interlocks
* Emergency stop circuits

**PM Expectations:**

* Functional testing
* Documentation of test results

**Validation Impact:**

* Safety PM generally does not impact validation unless process interruption occurs

---

## 5. PM Frequency Guidelines

PM frequency shall be defined based on:

* Machine usage (hours, cycles)
* Application risk (medical vs non-medical)
* OEM recommendations
* Historical performance data

Typical categories:

* Daily / Shift-based checks
* Weekly inspections
* Monthly / Quarterly PM
* Annual overhaul

---

## 6. Documentation and Records

Machine PM records shall include:

* Date and type of PM
* Components serviced
* Parts replaced
* Observations and measurements
* Approval of PM completion

Records shall be traceable to the specific machine and retained per regulatory requirements.

---

## 7. PM Deviations and Missed Maintenance

Missed or overdue PM on critical systems shall:

* Be documented
* Trigger a risk assessment
* Require approval prior to continued production

---

## 8. Integration with Validation and Change Control

Under OpenIMMS:

* Routine PM does not require revalidation
* Critical PM requires documented validation impact assessment
* Revalidation decisions shall be risk-based and justified

---

## 9. Governance

These machine PM expectations:

* Are mandatory for OpenIMMS adoption
* May be expanded by site-specific procedures
* Shall not be reduced without documented technical justification

---

## 10. Disclaimer

This document defines minimum expectations under OpenIMMS. Organizations remain responsible for defining detailed PM procedures, execution frequency, and regulatory compliance based on their specific equipment and applications.
