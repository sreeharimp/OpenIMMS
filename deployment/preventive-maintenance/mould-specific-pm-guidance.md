# OpenIMMS – Mould-Specific Preventive Maintenance (PM) Guidance

**Risk-Based, Mould-Level Preventive Maintenance to Sustain the Validated State**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how **mould-specific preventive maintenance (PM)** plans shall be established, approved, and maintained under OpenIMMS.

While generic mould PM defines minimum expectations, mould-specific PM ensures that **each validated mould** is maintained in a manner appropriate to its:

* Design complexity
* Material processed
* Process sensitivity
* Product and patient risk

The objective is to prevent uncontrolled variation while allowing scalable deployment across many moulds.

---

## 2. Scope

This guidance applies to:

* All injection moulds used in OpenIMMS-validated processes
* New mould introduction
* Existing moulds undergoing validation or revalidation
* Multi-site or multi-machine mould usage

---

## 3. Core Principle

> **Each validated mould shall have a mould-specific PM plan approved as part of the validation lifecycle.**

Generic PM alone is not sufficient to preserve the validated state for high-risk or sensitive moulds.

---

## 4. Inputs to Mould-Specific PM Definition

A mould-specific PM plan shall be defined using the following inputs:

### 4.1 Mould Design Characteristics

* Number of cavities
* Presence of slides, lifters, or collapsible cores
* Hot runner vs cold runner
* Tolerance sensitivity of critical features

### 4.2 Material Processed

Material properties significantly influence wear, deposits, and corrosion risk.

Examples:

* **PVC / plasticized materials** – corrosion, fume deposits
* **Glass-filled materials** – abrasive wear
* **Medical-grade materials** – contamination sensitivity

---

### 4.3 Process Sensitivity (SIM Output)

Outputs from SIM studies shall be reviewed to identify:

* Sensitivity to pressure
* Sensitivity to temperature
* Sensitivity to cooling efficiency

Highly sensitive processes require tighter PM intervals.

---

### 4.4 Risk Classification

Moulds shall be classified based on product and process risk:

| Risk Class | Typical Application                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| High       | Medical, safety-critical components |
| Medium     | Functional industrial / automotive  |
| Low        | Non-critical components             |

---

## 5. Defining Mould-Specific PM Intervals

PM intervals shall be defined using one or more of the following bases:

* **Shot count** (preferred)
* **Production hours**
* **Calendar time** (where shot data is unavailable)

### Example Guideline

| Risk Class | Typical PM Trigger |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| High       | 50k–100k shots     |
| Medium     | 150k–300k shots    |
| Low        | ≥500k shots        |

Actual intervals shall be justified and documented.

---

## 6. Content of a Mould-Specific PM Plan

Each mould-specific PM plan shall define:

* Mould identification and revision
* Risk classification
* PM trigger criteria
* Areas requiring special attention
* Approved cleaning agents and lubricants
* Acceptance criteria after PM
* Validation impact rules

---

## 7. Validation and Change Control Linkage

### 7.1 Routine PM

Routine mould-specific PM executed within the approved plan:

* Does **not** require revalidation
* Shall be recorded and approved

---

### 7.2 Critical PM

The following activities require validation impact assessment:

* Dimensional restoration or welding
* Gate or vent modification
* Cooling circuit modification
* Replacement of critical inserts

Revalidation (partial or full) shall be determined based on risk.

---

## 8. Storage, Handling, and Preservation

Mould-specific PM plans shall also define:

* Corrosion protection during storage
* Handling and transport precautions
* Environmental controls for long-term storage

These measures are especially critical for medical and PVC-processing moulds.

---

## 9. Documentation and Records

Records shall include:

* Approved mould-specific PM plan
* PM execution records
* Findings and corrective actions
* Validation impact assessments (where applicable)

Records shall be traceable to the mould and retained per regulatory requirements.

---

## 10. Governance

Mould-specific PM plans under OpenIMMS:

* Are mandatory for high-risk moulds
* Shall be approved by engineering and quality
* Shall not be modified without documented justification

---

## 11. Disclaimer

This guidance defines the OpenIMMS approach to mould-specific preventive maintenance. Organizations remain responsible for defining detailed procedures, PM intervals, and regulatory compliance based on their specific moulds, materials, and applications.
