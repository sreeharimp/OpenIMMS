# OpenIMMS – Mould Preventive Maintenance Expectations

**Maintaining Mould Condition to Preserve Process Capability and Product Quality**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the minimum preventive maintenance (PM) expectations for injection moulds under OpenIMMS. It establishes standardized requirements to ensure moulds remain in a condition consistent with the validated process window and continue to produce conforming parts.

Mould PM is treated as a **critical risk control measure** supporting product quality, patient safety (where applicable), and long-term process stability.

---

## 2. Scope

These expectations apply to:

* Injection moulds (single- and multi-cavity)
* Hot runner and cold runner systems
* Inserts, slides, lifters, and ejection systems
* All moulds used in OpenIMMS-adopted processes

---

## 3. PM Classification

Mould PM activities are classified as:

* **Routine PM** – Cleaning, inspection, and servicing with no change to mould geometry
* **Critical PM** – Activities that may affect part geometry, flow, cooling, or ejection and require validation impact assessment

---

## 4. Mandatory Mould PM Areas

The following mould areas are considered **critical** and shall be included in PM programs.

---

### 4.1 Cavities and Cores

**PM Expectations:**

* Visual inspection for wear, damage, corrosion, or plating loss
* Removal of deposits, residues, or build-up
* Protection against corrosion during storage

**Validation Impact:**

* Repair, welding, polishing, or dimensional changes require validation impact assessment

---

### 4.2 Gates and Runners

**PM Expectations:**

* Inspection for wear, blockage, or deformation
* Verification of gate integrity and finish
* Hot runner tip and manifold inspection (if applicable)

**Validation Impact:**

* Gate size or geometry changes require OQ impact assessment

---

### 4.3 Venting

**PM Expectations:**

* Cleaning and inspection of vents
* Verification of vent depth and continuity

**Validation Impact:**

* Vent modification may affect fill behavior and requires assessment

---

### 4.4 Cooling Circuits

**PM Expectations:**

* Flushing and cleaning of cooling channels
* Leak inspection
* Verification of flow and temperature performance

**Validation Impact:**

* Cooling circuit modification requires validation impact assessment

---

### 4.5 Ejection System

**PM Expectations:**

* Inspection of ejector pins, sleeves, lifters, and return mechanisms
* Lubrication using approved agents
* Verification of smooth and complete ejection

**Validation Impact:**

* Changes affecting ejection force or timing require assessment

---

### 4.6 Slides, Lifters, and Moving Components

**PM Expectations:**

* Inspection for wear and alignment
* Lubrication using controlled lubricants
* Verification of travel and timing

**Validation Impact:**

* Geometry or timing changes require validation impact assessment

---

## 5. Cleaning and Contamination Control

For regulated and medical applications:

* Only approved cleaning agents shall be used
* Residue-free cleaning shall be verified
* Corrosion inhibitors shall be compatible with materials and products

Contamination risks shall be assessed as part of mould PM.

---

## 6. PM Frequency Guidelines

Mould PM frequency shall be defined based on:

* Shot count
* Material type and abrasiveness
* Product risk classification
* Historical mould performance

Typical triggers include:

* Scheduled shot intervals
* Visual condition indicators
* Process stability trends

---

## 7. Documentation and Records

Mould PM records shall include:

* Mould ID and revision
* Date and type of PM
* Areas serviced
* Observations and corrective actions
* Approval of PM completion

Records shall be traceable to the mould and retained per regulatory requirements.

---

## 8. PM Deviations and Missed Maintenance

Missed or overdue mould PM on critical areas shall:

* Be documented
* Trigger a risk assessment
* Require approval prior to continued production

---

## 9. Integration with Validation and Change Control

Under OpenIMMS:

* Routine mould PM does not require revalidation
* Critical mould PM requires documented validation impact assessment
* Revalidation decisions shall be risk-based and justified

---

## 10. Governance

These mould PM expectations:

* Are mandatory for OpenIMMS adoption
* May be supplemented by mould-specific PM plans
* Shall not be weakened without documented technical justification

---

## 11. Disclaimer

This document defines minimum mould preventive maintenance expectations under OpenIMMS. Organizations remain responsible for defining detailed PM procedures, execution frequency, and regulatory compliance based on their specific mould designs and applications.
